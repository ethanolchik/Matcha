# Matcha
üçµ A caffeinated programming language for the modern world.

# Progress
Matcha is currently WIP. The compiler development is incomplete, however, here is a roadmap:

- [x] Lexical Analysis
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Name Resolution
- [ ] Typechecking
- [ ] Garbage Collection
- [ ] Code Generation

I am currently developing this programming language as a hobby and so the development process will be slow.
